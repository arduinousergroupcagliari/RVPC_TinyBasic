# RVPC_TinyBasic
Simple BASIC interpreter for [Olimex RVPC (1â‚¬ PC)](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Retro-Computers/RVPC/open-source-hardware)

## Compiling
Install [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) for your platform, add the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) plugin and install inside it the [platform-ch32v](https://github.com/Community-PIO-CH32V/platform-ch32v). Download or sync this repository and open it using vscode, then compile it clicking on the "check" symbol on the lower left status bar.

NB: because resources are limited, the stack size was reduced from 256 to 192 bytes in order to fit nicely inside the ch32v003. To change this setting, open <user_home>/.platformio/platforms/ch32v/builder/frameworks/noneos_sdk.py Look for stack_size = 256 and change it to 192 (row 44). At moment there is no other way to resize the stack but manually "mess" with the framework. I submitted an [issue](https://github.com/Community-PIO-CH32V/platform-ch32v/issues/90) to the platform owners in order to enable the foreseen parameter (build.stack_size).

There are plenty of tutorial to use vscode/platformio. If you don't feel inclined to compile, you can download the binary from the release section.

## Flashing
The official way to flash and debug software on ch32vxxx series of MCUs is using the [WCH-LinkE USB programmer](https://www.wch-ic.com/products/WCH-Link.html). Only the "E" model works.
There are also at least two other ways at moment, to flash: using a raspi pico or an ESP32 as a programmer. This is the raspi pico implementation: [picorvd](https://github.com/aappleby/picorvd).

If you own a Flipper Zero is possible to flash ch32Vxxx MCUs using this useful tool: [wch_swio_flasher](https://github.com/sukvojte/wch_swio_flasher)
